     * Find the largest sum of connected cells in a grid where movement is allowed
     * to adjacent (up/down/left/right) cells.
     * 
     * When to Use BFS vs DFS vs DSU
     * Algorithm - Use Case - Pros - Cons
     * DFS Small grids, connected components, simple sum Easy to code recursively,
     * minimal code Stack overflow risk for large grids
     * BFS Large grids, shortest path problems Avoids stack overflow, level-order
     * traversal Slightly more code for queue management
     * DSU Dynamic connectivity, grouping cells Efficient for merging sets Harder to
     * track sums, overkill for simple sums
     * Why DFS Here?
     * 
     * Grid size is small (â‰¤10x10).
     * Directly sum values during traversal.
     * Minimal code (4-6 lines for DFS).
